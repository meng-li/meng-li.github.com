About 1,000 people were being monitored by health officials. Several schools in Texas and Ohio shut down because of a single patient who boarded a plane. A cruise ship was refused permission to dock in Cozumel, off Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. President Obama appointed an Ebola "czar." Polls showed a majority of Americans were concerned that Ebola would spread out of control in the U.S.

On Tuesday, a fully recovered Dr. Craig Spencer was released from Bellevue Hospital Center in Manhattan. The U.S. was now Ebola-free for the first time since Sept. 5 â€” a milestone that barely seemed to register with a once-frenzied public.

Angst and anxiety gave way to calm as the days ticked by and no new patients were diagnosed. Meanwhile, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other health authorities upped their game after Thomas Eric Duncan's arrival at a Dallas emergency room revealed major gaps in the public health system.

"It's hard to say definitively why the public thinks anything, but this is a welcome return to normalcy," said Andrew Noymer, a professor of public health at UC Irvine.

Spencer was the ninth person in the United States to be treated for Ebola and the eighth to survive. The only fatality was Duncan, who contracted the virus in his native Liberia.

Ebola is suspected of killing nearly 5,000 people in West Africa, but so far, public health officials have made good on CDC Director Thomas Frieden's pledge to stop the virus dead in its tracks in the United States.

They instituted medical "SWAT teams" prepared to help local hospitals deal with potential Ebola patients and upgraded guidelines for personal protective gear. Officials also designated several regional hospitals with expertise in treating highly infectious diseases as Ebola care centers and routed all inbound flights from West Africa to five airports with enhanced passenger screening.

But the initial response left much to be desired.

When Duncan first sought care at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital on Sept. 25, the emergency room staff failed to make the correct diagnosis, delaying necessary care by three days. After two of his nurses became infected, medical workers openly questioned the CDC's advice on protective gear and other protocols. In cases where quarantines were imposed, it became clear that few had considered the logistics of providing food or disposing of trash for those affected.
