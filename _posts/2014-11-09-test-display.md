Yosemite National Park, which received enough snow last weekend to close the east-west Tioga Road until Friday, shows colors from black oaks and big-leaf maples that are expected to last until Thanksgiving.

For those who want to go farther, colors are near peak in the Shasta Cascade area, particularly along the Sacramento River and in Redding; Modoc National Forest; the Trinity River near Weaverville; and Mt. Shasta and its surroundings.

The loop around the lake covers about eight miles, but you can sample part of it if you don't want to go the entire distance. "Fall color should remain at peak through the coming week, weather permitting," the California Fall Color report says of the area.
